# Preface {.unnumbered}

**This website is an active work in progress. Please follow along, and please also excuse any typos!**

Like many other well-known names in the American Yiddish theater, Sam Kasten (written in Yiddish as "Kestin"), my great-great grandfather, published his memoirs as serialized articles in {{< var forverts >}} ([*The Forward*](https://forward.com), aka *The Jewish Daily Forward*), likely ghost written by [Mendel Osherowitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendel_Osherowitch).
Two articles per week, from September 1946 - February 1947, were published, for a total of 45 articles.

This e-book contains my translation of these memoirs, with some important caveats:

**This is an "alpha" version of the translation.**

I am only beginning to learn Yiddish. 
For my first pass at translating, I typed up all 45 articles into Google Translate and got some "good enough to get the gist" translations.

This e-book represents my second pass at translation, using my new beginner Yiddish skills and with lots of help from an English-Yiddish dictionary, posting on this website as I go. 
Throughout, I indicate spots where I'm very unsure of my translation.
Most of this is a highly verbatim translation, but in certain areas I do shift towards a more natural translation rephrased for the English ear.
As I continue learning Yiddish, I plan to update this translation over time as part of a long-term, living project dedicated to Sam's life and legacy, along with new translations of other articles he wrote and/or were written about him.

Where possible, I have cross-referenced items Sam discusses, as detailed in footnotes and inserted images.

I obtained all memoirs articles from [The National Library of Israel](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/frw) and, for those newspaper editions that were not available online, from the [New York Public Library's](https://www.nypl.org/) microfiche archives.

Many thanks to librarians at [NYPL's Dorot Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/jewish-division) for support finding the "missing" articles!
Thanks also to Steve Lasky and other volunteers who have contributed to the *Museum of the Family History* for making many translations from [Zalmen Zylbercweig's {{< var leks >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex-biography.htm) available! They have been invaluable for cross-referencing.

In memory of Sol Glassman ז׳׳ל, whose untimely death sent me down an ancestry rabbit hole wherein I accidentally ended up at Sam (who is wholly unrelated to Sol), and discovered a treasure trove of Yiddish writings.
Uniting the two sides of my family through Yiddish Theater is, simply put, {{< var beshert >}}.
