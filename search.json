    "text": "Preface\nThis website is an active work in progress.\nLike many other well-known names in the American Yiddish theater, Sam Kasten (written in Yiddish as “Kestin”), my great-great grandfather, published his memoirs as serialized articles in Forverts (The Forward, aka The Jewish Daily Forward). He wrote two articles per week1, from September 1946 - February 1947.\nI obtained all articles from The National Library of Israel, and, for those newspaper editions that were not available online, from the New York Public Library’s microfiche archives.\nThis e-book contains my translation of these memoirs, with some important caveats:\nThis is an “alpha” version of the translation.\nI do not (yet!) really know Yiddish (although I’ve picked up a lot along the way!), so I performed all translating by typing into Google Translate, with some help from a separate dictionary. Rather than directly typing what Google Translate has spit out, I’ve rephrased things so they flow well in English. For the most part, I believe I have retained the original meanings, but it’s worth noting that I may not have correctly gotten the original meaning!\nWhere possible, I have cross-referenced items Sam discusses, as detailed in footnotes and inserted images. All newspaper clippings are from archives in The National Library of Israel.\nAs I formally begin my journey to learn Yiddish, I will likely update this translation over time as part of a long-term, living project dedicated to Sam’s life and legacy.\nMany thanks to librarians at NYPL’s Dorot Division for support finding the “missing” articles! Thanks also to Steve Lasky and other volunteers who have contributed to the Museum of the Yiddish Theatre for making many translations from Zalmen Zylbercweig’s “Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater” available! They have been invalubale for cross-listing.\nIn memory of Sol Glassman ז׳׳ל, whose untimely death sent me down an ancestry rabbit hole wherein I accidentally ended up at Sam (who is wholly unrelated to Sol), and discovered a treasure trove of Yiddish writings. Uniting the two sides of my family through Yiddish Theater is, simply put, beshert."
