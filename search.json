    "text": "Preface\nThis website is an active work in progress. Please follow along!\nLike many other well-known names in the American Yiddish theater, Sam Kasten (written in Yiddish as “Kestin”), my great-great grandfather, published his memoirs as serialized articles in Forverts (The Forward, aka The Jewish Daily Forward). He (generally) wrote two articles per week, from September 1946 - February 1947, for a total of 45 articles (note that I added the “section dividers”.)\nI obtained all memoirs articles from The National Library of Israel, and, for those newspaper editions that were not available online, from the New York Public Library’s microfiche archives.\nThis e-book contains my translation of these memoirs, with some important caveats:\nThis is an “alpha” version of the translation.\nI do not (yet!) really know Yiddish (although I’ve picked up a lot along the way!), so I performed all translating by typing into Google Translate, with lots of assistance from an English-Yiddish dictionary (which, happily, includes idioms and phrases!).\nI’ve completed cursory translations all of the articles, and I am now in the process of cleaning them up, posting on this website as I go. Throughout, I indicate spots where I’m very unsure of my translation, but on the whole, I think this is pretty close to what he wrote!\nWhere possible, I have cross-referenced items Sam discusses, as detailed in footnotes and inserted images. Unless otherwise stated, all newspaper clippings are from archives in The National Library of Israel.\nAs I formally begin my journey to learn Yiddish, I will likely update this translation over time as part of a long-term, living project dedicated to Sam’s life and legacy.\nMany thanks to librarians at NYPL’s Dorot Division for support finding the “missing” articles! Thanks also to Steve Lasky and other volunteers who have contributed to the Museum of the Yiddish Theatre for making many translations from Zalmen Zylbercweig’s “Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater” available! They have been invaluable for cross-referencing.\nIn memory of Sol Glassman ז׳׳ל, whose untimely death sent me down an ancestry rabbit hole wherein I accidentally ended up at Sam (who is wholly unrelated to Sol), and discovered a treasure trove of Yiddish writings. Uniting the two sides of my family through Yiddish Theater is, simply put, beshert.."
