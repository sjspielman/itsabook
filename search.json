    "text": "Preface\nThis website is an active work in progress.\nLike many other well-known names in the American Yiddish theater, Sam Kasten (written in Yiddish as “Kestin”), my great-great grandfather, published his memoirs as serialized articles in Forverts (The Forward, aka The Jewish Daily Forward). He wrote two articles per week, from September 1946 - February 1947.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning advertisement in Forverts for Sam’s memoir series. Image from 1946-09-01 edition.\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Kestin describes of 50 years of Yiddish Theater\nThe famous comedian, who for 50 years has been dancing and singing on the Yiddish stage, tells his memories the “Forverts”. Dramatic, romantic, funny, and comical tales that occurred in and around the Yiddish theater in the last half century.\nStart reading Sam Kestin’s articles in the Forverts Saturday, September 7th. The articles will appear twice a week, Wednesday and Saturday.\n\n\n\n\nI obtained all articles from The National Library of Israel, and, for those newspaper editions that were not available online, from the New York Public Library’s microfiche archives.\nThis e-book contains my translation of these memoirs, with some important caveats:\nThis is an “alpha” version of the translation.\nI do not (yet!) really know Yiddish, so I performed all translating by typing into Google Translate, with some help from a separate dictionary. Rather than directly typing what Google Translate has spit out, I’ve rephrased things so they flow well in English. For the most part, I believe I have retained the original meanings, but it’s worth noting that I may not have correctly gotten the original meaning!\nWhere possible, I have cross-referenced items Sam discusses, as detailed in footnotes and inserted images. All newspaper clippings are from archives in The National Library of Israel.\nAs I begin my journey to learn Yiddish, I plan to return and update this translation as part of a very long-term project.\nMuch thanks to Steve Lasky and other volunteers at the Museum of the Yiddish Theatre for making many translations from Zalmen Zylbercweig’s “Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater” available! Thanks also to librarians at NYPL’s Dorot Division for support finding the “missing” articles!\n\nIn memory of Sol Glassman ז׳׳ל, whose untimely death sent me down an ancestry rabbit hole wherein I accidentally ended up at Sam (who is wholly unrelated to Sol), and discovered a treasure trove of Yiddish writings. Uniting the two sides of my family through Yiddish Theater is, simply put, beshert."
