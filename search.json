    "text": "Preface\nThis website is an active work in progress. Please follow along!\nLike many other well-known names in the American Yiddish theater, Sam Kasten (written in Yiddish as “Kestin”), my great-great grandfather, published his memoirs as serialized articles in Forverts (The Forward, aka The Jewish Daily Forward). He (generally) wrote two articles per week, from September 1946 - February 1947, for a total of 45 articles (note that I added the “section dividers”.)\nI obtained all memoirs articles from The National Library of Israel, and, for those newspaper editions that were not available online, from the New York Public Library’s microfiche archives.\nThis e-book contains my translation of these memoirs, with some important caveats:\nThis is an “alpha” version of the translation.\nI do not (yet!) really know Yiddish (although I’ve picked up a lot along the way!), so I performed all translating by typing into Google Translate, with lots of assistance from an English-Yiddish dictionary (which, happily, includes idioms and phrases!).\nI’ve completed cursory translations all of the articles, and I am now in the process of cleaning them up, posting on this website as I go. Throughout, I indicate spots where I’m very unsure of my translation.\nWhere possible, I have cross-referenced items Sam discusses, as detailed in footnotes and inserted images. Unless otherwise stated, all newspaper clippings are from archives in The National Library of Israel.\nAs I formally begin my journey to learn Yiddish, I will likely update this translation over time as part of a long-term, living project dedicated to Sam’s life and legacy.\nMany thanks to librarians at NYPL’s Dorot Division for support finding the “missing” articles! Thanks also to Steve Lasky and other volunteers who have contributed to the Museum of the Yiddish Theatre for making many translations from Zalmen Zylbercweig’s “Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater” available! They have been invaluable for cross-referencing.\nIn memory of Sol Glassman ז׳׳ל, whose untimely death sent me down an ancestry rabbit hole wherein I accidentally ended up at Sam (who is wholly unrelated to Sol), and discovered a treasure trove of Yiddish writings. Uniting the two sides of my family through Yiddish Theater is, simply put, beshert."

    "text": "16.1 CHAPTER IN PROGRESS\n\n\nThe frequent quarrels among Yiddish actors of old. - They used to fight over their source of income, over roles, and even more over love1. - A quarrel between the actors Schoengold and Tanzman, because of Mrs. Tanzman’s role.\n\nTogether with Frank and with Jakele Cone, I schlepped around the provinces and it was, as they say, all ups and downs - here it was good and there it, and it turned out like in Pharaoh’s dream: The seven lean cows ate the seven fat cows, and you were always twisting your head wondering what would come next.\nOftentimes it was like this - we would arrived in a city just when, only a few days earlier, another wandering troupe had just departed, and they had just “skimmed the top off” so there was nothing left for us. Sometimes, just as we arrived in a city, we would meet another wandering Yiddish troupe who was playing the same plays that we had chosen to play.\nIn general, there was terrible and fearful confusion; People tripped over each other’s feet, bumped into each other’s heads, and everyone got in one another’s way.\nIn more than one city, Jakele Cone displayed his resourcefulness to get to out of an unpleasant situation, and on a regular basis, an ingenious idea would strike him upon and it was really something astonishing, and the main thing was - as bad as it got, he didn’t give up and he always encouraged us. Even when he himself was feeling down2, he nonetheless was still able to pass the time reading Shakespeare’s Halmet for the umpteenth time, always exclaiming with enthusiasm:\n– I say, khevreh3, this is a play - a rare thing in this world!\nHe was always reading plays. Printed and also hand-written. And he had a such good memory, that it was enough for him to just see a play on the stage once or twice, and he had already memorized it…\nOn top of this, he also always dressed very nicely and elegantly, and I liked that very much about him, because I always liked to dress nicely and elegantly And Jakele Cone always behaved like a real gentleman who really attracted the ladies…\nWhile wandering from city to city, we never arrived anywhere prepared; No one expected us anywhere and no one was eagerly awaiting our arrival. We just wandered, in demand or not. Sometimes you found yourself in a good spot, or sometimes you didn’t and it was bad, and in those times it was really miserable and gloomy. And once, when we arrived in Cleveland, we were straight away given some good news - the troupe of Abba Schoengold and Mr. and Mrs. Tanzman was already playing here. The same troupe that I left after fighting with Tanzman.\nI mention this, because from what I am going to tell you, you will be able to get a sense of the atmosphere that then reigned in our theater circles, and all in all is very characteristic of all the chaos of that era.\nIt was necessary for one of us to meet with Tanzman and talk with him about what could be done so that we could also make something out of being in Cleveland and so that we could at least continue to cover our expenses. And it was decided that Frank should to go to Tanzman. I could not go to Tanzman because we had fought.\nSo Frank went to him and he didn’t come back…\nHe stayed with Tanzman’s troupe and and played with them there, and where were left neither here nor there4, so Jakele Cone also left and I was left alone and exposed and there was nothing I could do.\nThat’s how Tanzman got even with me for the fight we had had before in Baltimore. He could not forget about it, and he could not let go of his anger towards until he got his revenge.\nIn general, Yiddish actors in the troupes at that time already had a fought a little too much, not only about income and about roles, but also about various other kinds of things; Morale was not at all high, and when an actor had a jealous wife, or an actress had a jealous husband, tempestuous and boisterous scenes often played out, and everyone had something to talk about and someone to gossip about; Everyone was talking about some kind of episode, and it was nothing new for someone to steal another’s wife or husband. And when such a thing happened, the whole troupe was thrown into such a tumult over it, and they all cast the blame at one another sins at each other, and it was such a mess…"
