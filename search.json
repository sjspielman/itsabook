    "text": "Preface\nThis website is an active work in progress. Please follow along, and please also excuse any typos!\nLike many other well-known names in the American Yiddish theater, Sam Kasten (written in Yiddish as “Kestin”), my great-great grandfather, published his memoirs as serialized articles in Forverts (The Forward, aka The Jewish Daily Forward). He (generally) wrote two articles per week, from September 1946 - February 1947, for a total of 45 articles (note that I added the “section dividers”.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning advertisement in Forverts for Sam’s memoir series. Image from 1946-09-01 edition.\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Kestin describes of 50 years of Yiddish Theater\nThe famous comedian, who for 50 years has been dancing and singing on the Yiddish stage, tells his memories for the Forverts. Dramatic, romantic, funny, and comical tales that occurred in and around the Yiddish theater in the last half century.\nStart reading Sam Kestin’s articles in theForverts Saturday, September 7th. The articles will appear twice a week, Thursday and Saturday.\n\n\n\n\nThis e-book contains my translation of these memoirs, with some important caveats:\nThis is an “alpha” version of the translation.\nI am only beginning to learn Yiddish. For my first pass at translating, I typed up all 45 articles into Google Translate and got some “good enough to get the gist” translations.\nThis e-book represents my second pass at translation, using my new beginner Yiddish skills and with lots (lots) of help from an English-Yiddish dictionary, posting on this website as I go. Throughout, I indicate spots where I’m very unsure of my translation. In general, I usually provide a more “verbatim” translation rather than heavily rephrasing it for the English ear. As a beginner Yiddish speaker, I felt this decision would more likely result in fewer mistranslations, though if I am very confident in the inherent meaning, I will use more “English” phrasing in certain places.\nAs I continue learning Yiddish, I hope to update this translation over time as part of a long-term, living project dedicated to Sam’s life and legacy.\nWhere possible, I have cross-referenced items Sam discusses, as detailed in footnotes and inserted images.\nI obtained all memoirs articles from The National Library of Israel and, for those newspaper editions that were not available online, from the New York Public Library’s microfiche archives.\nMany thanks to librarians at NYPL’s Dorot Division for support finding the “missing” articles! Thanks also to Steve Lasky and other volunteers who have contributed to the Museum of the Yiddish Theatre for making many translations from Zalmen Zylbercweig’s “Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater” available! They have been invaluable for cross-referencing.\n\nIn memory of Sol Glassman ז׳׳ל, whose untimely death sent me down an ancestry rabbit hole wherein I accidentally ended up at Sam (who is wholly unrelated to Sol), and discovered a treasure trove of Yiddish writings. Uniting the two sides of my family through Yiddish Theater is, simply put, beshert."
