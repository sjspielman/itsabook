> How Yiddish theater used to be played in the provinces. -- The true owners of the plays were not the writers, but the suppliers.

Mr. {{< var himmelfarb >}}'s plan was comprised of this - he had established a club in Cincinnati into which he brought all the good Jews who really loved the Yiddish theater with all their hearts. He made them members of the club; and everyone paid a certain amount, and officials were elected and meetings were held, and it was that we would play what the audience - the members of the club - asked for.

-- You understand, - Mr. {{< var himmelfarb >}} said to us, - here in Cincinnati, we love historical plays. {{< var Nu >}}, we want your first performance to be {{< var barkochba >}}. Can you play {{< var barkochba >}}?

We didn't need to think for a long time about what kind of answer we should give him. The answer was very short:

-- {{< var Nu >}}, of course we can play {{< var barkochba >}}. What can't we play?...

It was really touching to see how the Jewish community in Cincinnati yearned for historical operettas like {{< var goldfaden >}}'s. So touching that, even if we didn't know {{< var barkochba >}}, or all of {{< var goldfaden >}}'s other historical operettas that we performed there later, we would not have had the heart to refuse to them.

And you should have seen what joy there was in Cincinnati at our first performance of {{< var barkochba >}}! 

They, all the Jews of Cincinnati who came to see us perform {{< var goldfaden-full >}}'s hysterical operetta, carried themselves with a poise that felt closer times of {{< var bar-kochba-person >}} than to the times in which they lived. And when it came to the song {{< var zions-daughters >}}^[Sam calls this song "Zion's daughters are all crying," which is actually the [first line of the song](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A81016) but not its actual title.], there was no need for a choir at all, because almost everyone in the theater sang with us. You only had to start the song, and soon everyone sang along:

> ^[Translation by me, hopefully not _too_ bad!]Zion's daughters are all crying, 
>
> Lament, children, all together, 
>
> Over our hardship in these dark times,
>
> Over what has befallen our land.
>
> Our star has fallen, 
>
> And the earth is sullied;
>
> Broken is our star, our crown
>
> That once adorned us.
>
> Oi, God, look upon our tears, 
>
> Our suffering and pain;
>
> We will not cease crying 
>
> Until you come to our aid.


The audience nodded along while singing. And they nodded along even more when we reached the part of the song about the {{< var khurbn >}}^[destruction. This term, in Yiddish, is used to describe the destruction of the first and second Temples, and the Holocaust. It specifically implies a catastrophic event in the Jewish collective memory.] of Jerusalem.

> Rich as a king with diamonds
>
> Was the holy city.
> 
> Dignified on all side,
>
> It had such glory, so full of grace.
>
> The stars amidst the moon, 
>
> We would gaze upon from it;
>
> And today she is a widow
>
> And we are orphaned from her.


And then again, louder than before: 


> Oi, God, look upon our tears, 
>
> Our suffering and pain;
>
> We will not cease crying 
>
> Until you come to our aid.
