> My wandering around the provinces. -- {{< var gordin-full >}} comes to St. Louis to stage the play [{{< var mirele-efros >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirele_Efros)^[Information about the [1939 film](https://jewishfilm.org/Catalogue/films/mireleefros.htm).] and I perform in the play. --  Yiddish actors' attitude towards {{< var gordin-full >}}.

During the half-a-year that we played in Cincinnati and things went well for us, I corresponded from time to time with my old friend {{< var karp-full >}}, and I made him an offer to come to Cincinnati and play together with us.

I remembered that it would be good when he came to us, and in the letters that I wrote to him, I always mentioned that, as for his children who he always brought with him because he loved them very much, he doesn't need to worry at all, because it is more than certain that here with us in Cincinnati, he will definitely find a nice respectable family who take good care of them and they will feel as though it was their home, and it won't cost him a lot.

But {{< var karp >}} was always busy with his travels all around other cities; It seemed he had no desire to come to us, and when, finally, he did come, it was already getting towards the end [of our time in Cincinnati] and things were not going so well for us. {{< var karp >}} immediately took a dislike to Cincinnati and on all the good Jews around us, and he insisted that we go with him to Louisville, Kentucky.

-- Why have you become so sullen about Cincinnati? - he scowled. - _Cincinneti, Cincinn-shmeti_... Now, Louisville, Kentucky - _that_ is a city!...

And so we left and went to Louisville, Kentucky, and there we put on several performances, and then something I didn't expect at all happened...

Just then when were playing in Louisville, Kentucky, Tanzman arrived there with his troupe. {{< var Nu >}}, as you might expect, competition between us started right away, but that didn't stop the actors and actresses from both troupes from meeting up and spending time with each other. And it ended with someone from our troupe having an affair with one of Tanzman's sisters, and she immediately admitted into our troupe. We all became close pals with each other, and in the end they all went off together to play in another city and I was left behind, just as if I was a spare part...

{{< var schoen >}} even tried to stand up for me. But interceding for my wife and I did not help, because the actor's love affair with Tanzman's sister - who, by the way, was really quite beautiful - created a situation where the troupe didn't need me and my wife any longer, and on top of that, there were the usual series of^[again, he uses סדרה here, which implies a regular/expected order] intrigues and reminders of old feuds, so I could no longer be in the troupe.

All these things are very characteristic of the chaotic situation that prevailed in our Yiddish theater world in those times. Nobody had contracts, nobody owed each other anything, you were always subject to the whims of this and that, and it was quite a common thing that, over some occurrence that lasted no longer than the Fast of Esther at {{< var purim >}}^[This is an idiom (note there is indeed a [Fast of Esther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_of_Esther)) meaning that something does not take a long time or ends quickly/abruptly. So, Sam means that the occurrence didn't last longer than something that already is over quickly - an _extremely short-lived_ occurrence], a troupe would go through complete upheaval and completely abandon some actors, who would get left behind...

I really resented that I was treated that way. I felt sorry for myself that I had to part with such good friends as {{< var abba-full >}}, {{< var frank-full >}}, and {{< var jakele-full >}}. But I had no other choice, and my wife and I back to our family in Philadelphia, the same city where I settled after I arrived in America with a lot of high hopes. We lived off the money we had saved from the good times we had had in Cincinnati, we started preparing and I hoped that I would not go around empty for a long time.

At that time I was already a father of two children. We had a son and a daughter^[Their daughter Lily was born April 1898 in Cleveland, so we are now in either in late 1898 or 1899]. And when week after week went by and I still had nothing to show for myself, I became very restless. I must have been restless, because the little sum of money I had saved up in Cincinnati was growing smaller and smaller. It had already "run dry," as we used to say. I left for New York, and with full confidence that by now people would have heard a lot about me there and they certainly knew about the great success I had had in Cincinnati, I went to {{< var thomash >}}, and also to {{< var adler >}}, and asked them to hire me.
