> The fear that theater fans had of roles belonging to the comedian {{< var berl-b >}}. -- {{< var bessie >}} in pants. -- {{< var edelstein-full >}} during the time when {{< var mogu >}} lost his voice.

Beginning the season^[1901-1902] in the People's Theater, we put on {{< var lateiner >}}'s operetta {{< var alexander-long >}}. In this operetta, {{< var boris >}} was always a big hit in the role of the crown prince. In the play, I performed the role of {{< var naftali >}}, who speaks to himself that the true crown prince is him alone. 

This was a role that the comedian {{< var berl-b >}} had held for a long time. He played this role many times in New York, and the audiences really loved him in this role. As such, he had a lot of fans who were ready to walk through fire and water for him. So, among them there was suddenly a {{< var behalah >}}^[a panic/chaos/uproar] - How could they give {{< var berl-b >}}'s role to Kestin?! Who even is he, this Kestin?! And how could he possibly compare to {{< var berl-b >}} in this role?! How could they do this to {{< var berl-b >}}'s legacy, to let Kestin take the stage in this role?!

These fans really thought they were in the right. It's not an exaggeration to say that, in those times, the Yiddish theater audiences really held an actor's fate in their hands. When an actor was in need, they completely devoted themselves to him, and there was nothing that they wouldn't do for him. If you ever dared to utter a bad word about their _liebling_^[darling; German origin word], they were ready to rip you to shreds.

The famous Yiddish actors like {{< var jacob-adler >}}, [{{< var kessler-full >}}]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kessler_(actor))), {{< var boris >}}, and also {{< var berl-b >}} all had these sort of fans who were ready to stick up for them. These fans didn't want to suffer me being given {{< var bern >}}'s role in the People's Theater...

They really fumed over this and worked themselves up, and they told us that, having thoroughly discussed the whole matter, they would all come to the first performance and watch me perform the entire role, and here's how it would go: They would let me perform the role of {{< var naftali >}} if I played it in a new way, different from how {{< var bern >}} plays it. But if I did not play the role differently and played it just as {{< var bern >}} would, then there would be hell to pay. They would make a huge scene in the theater and pelt me with rotten apples, and they would make sure that I would never perform on the stage again...
