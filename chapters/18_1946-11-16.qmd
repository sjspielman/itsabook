> My travels to Cincinnati with {{< var jakele-full >}} and {{< var frank-full >}}. -- A scene in a theater-lover's candy store.


Of all the luck and all the great success we had in Pittsburgh with {{< var lateiner >}}'s {{< var lostsoul >}}, we did not become rich. And when the luck ended and people started thinking about where to go next, {{< var abba-full >}} immediately had a plan ready:

-- We are going back to Baltimore!

In hearing Baltimore, I was struck with fear: 

-- Baltimore? Really? How can we go there and what will we do there? The audiences there certainly still remember the disaster in the theater; No one will come to our performance.

-- They will come, they will come. - {{< var schoen >}} answered me. - The audiences will hear that {{< var abba-full >}} is here again, so they will come to the theater to see him play, trust me.

He was so stubborn about it that it was simply impossible to convince him otherwise. And he indeed got his way - we left for Baltimore. But this time, {{< var schoen >}} did not succeed. And as though he had no obligation to me, because in those days there was never any talk in the provinces about such a thing as hiring an actor for a season, he drove off somewhere alone and didn't tell anyone where he was going or what prospects he had.

And I, in God's care alone, went to Buffalo, and when I got there, I met {{< var frank >}} and {{< var jakele-full >}} there again. Just like me, they also came there to "tap a wall" and see if they can play some shows there and earn a little money to be able to pay their expenses. And it turned, with the three of us together, it felt more {{< var haimlicher >}}...


And next we embarked on a "series"^[He uses the term _sidra_, as in weekly Torah portion] of wandering over the cities and towns, and I must say that in general we were a good "threesome,"^[As in, there are three of them.], by which I mean we really got used to living with each other, and even though it was often very bad for us and we didn't know what tomorrow would bring us and where we'd end up next playing Yiddish theater, but we never lost heart; {{< var frank >}} and I, the two comedians of the "threesome," made jokes at the expense of our own poverty, and the serious, often dead-serious {{< var jakele-full >}}, always fell upon another ingenious idea, and when he thought up something, he gave us the good news - 

-- {{< var Chevreh >}}, it will be good... You will see soon, that it will be good!...

As usual, all this good news was just fantasy, and afterwards we laughed at ourselves over it. In those days we really laughed with the lizards^[[Idiom](https://www.yiddishwit.com/gallery/lizards.html) meaning to laugh out of bitterness, not joy]...


So we {{< var schlepped >}} around for a long time, until we reached Cincinnati, and when we got there, all three of us together had, all in all, three and a half dollars... This was our entire worth that we had earned playing Yiddish theater 
in all the cities where there was an audience who would come to see us...

It was the beginning of winter. It was already cold outside and we were still walking around in our summer coats and we were shivering. But that didn't bother us. And with the full certainty that Cincinnati is a city where we could make money playing Yiddish theater, we stopped in a hotel, in a dirt-cheap hotel, and the arrangement we made for ourselves even made it seem that we were very lucky...

{{< var jakele-full >}} was certain he had heard somewhere that there was a Jew named {{< var himmelfarb >}} in Cincinnati who was one of those good Jews who were really in love with Yiddish theater, and on top of that he had a golden heart, a dear man. {{< var jakele-full >}} had heard that whenever Yiddish actors came to him, he would help them sell tickets and also find other local Jews who would help them, and in general he behaved in such a way that a wandering Yiddish actor in Cincinnati felt at home, and when the actor left, people would bid him farewell as though he were own of their own family.

{{< var Nu >}}, we had to go see this {{< var himmelfarb >}}, and there we'd make the best arrangements and we'd no longer have to worry. 

We had Mr. {{< var himmelfarb >}}'s address. We also knew that he had a "stationery store." On our way there, {{< var jakele-full >}} stopped to remind us something he had told us earlier:

-- {{< var Chevreh >}}, we have to seem impressive... This meeting is a big one... This is very important...


And here I want to emphasize^[My translation; Sam writes "dwell/linger on"] on a few details, which are, in my opinion, important, simply because they are very characteristic of the condition in which the Yiddish theater found itself in the provinces in America. Characteristic of the actors of the past and also characteristic of the really nice and good Jews who used to help out the actors who wandered around the provincial cities and dreamed of playing in New York.

When we arrived at Mr. {{< var himmelfarb >}}'s store, we behaved as though were very important and talked to him just as if every word were a piece of gold...

-- Mr. {{< var himmelfarb >}}?

-- Yes.

-- My name is {{< var jakele-last >}}, {{< var jakele-full >}}, as I'm sure you've heard.

-- And my name is Kestin, Sam Kestin - I introduced myself.

Even {{< var frank >}}, who by nature was a disheveled sort and had never been able keep up pretenses - even he, just like in a well-rehearsed role, really put on airs:

-- And my name is {{< var frank >}}. - He said this with a tone just like he was [Rav Bar Ashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rav_Ashi). - {{< var frank-full >}}... Of course you've heard of me, eh?

It is needless to say that Mr. {{< var himmelfarb >}} was not taken aback by our names; You could see that had certainly not heard of us, and he didn't know who we were. And then {{< var jakele-full >}} uttered three words, no more than three words, but with such a dramatic expression, just as if he had embarked on a really strong and intense monologue in one of Shakespeare's historical pieces: 

-- We are actors!...
