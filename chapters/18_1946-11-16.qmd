> My travels to Cincinnati with {{< var jakele-full >}} and {{< var frank-full >}}. -- A scene in a theater-lover's candy store.


Of all the luck and all the great success we had in Pittsburgh with {{< var lateiner >}}'s {{< var lostsoul >}}, we did not become rich. And when the luck ended and people started thinking about where to go next, {{< var abba-full >}} immediately had a plan ready:

-- We are going back to Baltimore!

In hearing Baltimore, I was struck with fear: 

-- Baltimore? Really? How can we go there and what will we do there? The audiences there certainly still remember the disaster in the theater; No one will come to our performance.

-- They will come, they will come. - {{< var schoen >}} answered me. - The audiences will hear that {{< var abba-full >}} is here again, so they will come to the theater to see him play, trust me.

He was so stubborn about it that it was simply impossible to convince him otherwise. And he indeed got his way - we left for Baltimore. But this time, {{< var schoen >}} did not succeed. And as though he had no obligation to me, because in those days there was never any talk in the provinces about such a thing as hiring an actor for a season, he drove off somewhere alone and didn't tell anyone where he was going or what prospects he had.

And I, in God's care alone, went to Buffalo, and when I got there, I met {{< var frank >}} and {{< var jakele-full >}} there again. Just like me, they also came there to "tap a wall" and see if they can play some shows there and earn a little money to be able to pay their expenses. And it turned, with the three of us together, it felt more {{< var haimlicher >}}...


And next we embarked on a "series"^[He uses the term _sidra_, as in weekly Torah portion] of wandering over the cities and towns, and I must say that in general we were a good "threesome,"^[As in, there are three of them.], by which I mean we really got used to living with each other, and even though it was often very bad for us and we didn't know what tomorrow would bring us and where we'd end up next playing Yiddish theater, but we never lost heart; {{< var frank >}} and I, the two comedians of the "threesome," made jokes at the expense of our own poverty, and the serious, often dead-serious {{< var jakele-full >}}, always fell upon another ingenious idea, and when he thought up something, he gave us the good news - 

-- {{< var Chevreh >}}, it will be good... You will see soon, that it will be good!...

As usual, all this good news was just fantasy and after we laughed at ourselve over it. In those days we really laughed with the lizards^[[Idiom](https://www.yiddishwit.com/gallery/lizards.html) meaning to laugh out of bitterness, not joy]...






As usual, all the good tidings have remained fantasies and we are laughing at ourselves. And once really laughed with lizards...
So we dragged ourselves around for a long time, until we stopped in Cincinnati, and when we got there, all three of us together had - around and around - three and a half dollarsâ€¦ This was the entire capital of ours, that we had theaters in all the cities, where there was only an audience that would come to see us...
It was the beginning of winter. It was already cold outside and we were still walking around in our summer coats and we were shivering. But that didn't bother us. And with the full certainty that Cincinnati is a city where you can make money from playing Yiddish theater, we stayed in a hotel, in a cheap hotel, and the arrangement that we had there was such that one could really think that we are very lucky here...
We then took the certainty of what Jeykel Cohen had heard somewhere, that there was a Jew named Himelfarb in Cincinnati, and he, Himelfarb, was one of those happy Jews who are really in love with Yiddish theater, and besides, he has a golden heart, a treasure, and we already know that whenever Jewish actors come there, he sees that they should have a place to play and he helps sell them tickets and he finds others who do the same for the actors, and in general he acts in such a way that a wandering Jewish actor in Cincinnati feels at home and when he leaves there, people say goodbye to him as if he were one of their own family.
