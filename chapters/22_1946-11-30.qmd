> In a troupe with the famous opera singer {{< var medvedev >}}. -- Why {{< var thomash >}} came all the way to Chicago to invite me to play in the People's Theater^[Formerly located at 199-201 Bowery, between Rivington and Spring Sts].


Among the cities, where I performed Yiddish theater in those times when I {{< var schlepped >}} all over America with wandering troupes, Chicago must also be mentioned. I can't leave the city out - not only because it was hard for me until I arrived there, but also because some things happened there that are etched in my memory, and it's worth mentioning them because they are connected with the history of Yiddish theater in America.

----

In playing in Chicago, I was no longer a wandering actor who was surprised by where life led him and where he spent his days or his nights. I came to Chicago to a real^[Sam uses the word "fixed"/"designated"; implies this theater is really a specific institution, not just a place the wandering actors found and rented out for a time] theater where a permanent troupe played, and the manager of the theater was [{{< var glickman >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/G/glickman-elias.htmvar)^[Read a [blog post about {{< var glickman >}}](http://undereverytombstone.blogspot.com/2013/10/he-brought-yiddish-theatre-to-chicago.html). According to his obituary, which is shown in the blog post, this theater was called "Metropolitan Hall" and was at the corner of Jefferson and O'Brien streets.]. {{< var glickman-full >}}, a Jew, who knew how to manage a theater and his dream was to create such a venue for the Yiddish stage in Chicago, that people wouldn't have to be ashamed of not being in New York.

Glickman himself once also dreamed of becoming an actor: in his younger years when he still lived in the city of [{{< var zhitomir >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhytomyr). He participated in Russian, Ukrainian, and also Yiddish performances. Also, when he came to America, he played on the stage, and he loved it so much that even when he was given the lowly role of an extra, he was satisfied. However, he soon realized that he was more suited to the business side of the theater than to acting on the stage. As he was not lacking in such skills and had made money in business, he became a theater manager in Chicago, and he conducted business such that it was known that when he hired an actor, they no longer had to wrack their brains over the question of their income because he was a manager who cared for them. 


At first, {{< var glickman >}} hired my wife. Apparently, he didn't have any desire to engage me then, or he didn't need me. But a few weeks later he sent for me, and when I arrived, he advertised me very well, and in a short time I became one of the pillars in the troupe, and I appeared in prominent roles and he was very satisfied with me.

In general, I was able to get along with people wherever I went; I was never one of those people who started fights. I could, and I still can, swallow a lot of things that weren't worth making a fuss over. I only got angry when people insulted me for no reason...

At {{< var glickman >}}'s theater in Chicago, I also got along well with the troupe, and I was satisfied that I didn't have to {{< var schlep >}} around like before. And no matter how much my wife and I earned, it was enough for us and we were happy with the fact that we have such precious children.

With this, I don't intend to present myself in such a light that you'd think I was a homebody or that I was a paragon of serious or dignified behavior. No, I wouldnâ€™t say that. I confess, when I was making a good living, I liked to go out with friends and acquaintances and have a good time. I usually did not refuse a good glass of wine and a good bit of liquor, and I knew how to live it up^[also translated as "run wild"] so that no one I went out with would be sad...

That's the kind of person I was. But I still knew "where one and how finished"^[This is an idiom I cannot translate, but I assume it means "when to behave this way and when not to" or similar]. And I have always loved my family, and my wife and children have always been very dear to me. I mention this just ecause it just came to mind while writing. And now I will continue to tell you about the times when I played at {{< var glickman >}}'s in Chicago.

As an experienced theater director, {{< var glickman >}} maintained that it was necessary to always have something new to attract the audience as much as possible. Because of this, from time to time, he would bring an actor with a big name to Chicago from New York. And when he once heard that there was a big fuss in New York over the opera singer {{< var max >}}, who came from Russia to America and was performing on the Yiddish stage, he didn't think twice about it, and he brought him to Chicago.

{{< var medvedev >}} was never much of an actor. He was merely a good singer, and in his younger years he excelled with his singing. But when we was brought to America, his voice wasn't the same as it used to be, and when people heard him sing, they were disappointed...

But it was still a bit of a sensation. People talked a lot about an opera singer stepping out onto the Yiddish stage playing together with all the other Jewish actors in the play. That alone was a sensation, because people had heard a lot about {{< var medvedev >}} before. And indeed that is why {{< var glickman >}} brought him down to Chicago.
