> Our troupe puts on {{< var gordin >}}'s plays in Cincinnati and wins the trust of the Jewish theater world. - How [Clara Rafalo](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/R/rafalo-clara.htm) became an actress.

No one in Cincinnati wanted to help us take the first step to play Yiddish theater and earn a little money. It turned out, as if/when?????? all the good Jews in the city had suddenly all agreed to blow cold, because they had just been burned. And this really irritated us so much since we wanted to show that we are good people. On top of that we had to do something about our situation because we didn't have the expenses to continue. 

With the few pennies we still had, we went to look for a suitable hall where we could play at least one show. And we just found such a hall and they requested from us merely than 15 dollars for the evening.

-- We have to play here - {{< var jakele-full >}} said. - Come thunder and lightning, we will give a performance here. And we want to perform {{< var gordin-full >}}'s {{< var jewish-priest >}}^[Available, in Yiddish handwritten script, from the [YIVO Archives](https://digipres.cjh.org/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE2725799)]. This is a strong melodrama and we will blow them away with it...

But where could we get a little money for the necessary expenses?

-- Here's a thought! - I said. - Let's sell out wristwatches...

-- And we'll also need to sell our coats. - {{< var frank >}} replied.

This made us laugh because he, the "red," as we called Frank^[He was a redhead], wore such a shabby coat that no one would given him even three bucks for it^[Not 100% confident in the exact wording of this translation, but the concept is correct.]...

Then we sold the watches and some other things that had a value, and this gave us the opportunity to put matters into our own hands. And after when we put a down payment on the hall and already had printed tickets, we went back to Mr. {{< var himmelfarb >}} with a request - indeed, the same request that we had had for him before:

-- Do us a {{< var toive >}}, Mr. {{< var himmelfarb >}}, and sell tickets to our show; We already have a hall to play in and a piece to perform. You will see soon enough...

This time Mr. {{< var himmelfarb >}} did not drive us out; He listened to us calmly and peacefully, and then he said:

-- {{< var Nu >}}, {{< var mila >}}^["so be it"], I will take tickets from you to sell, but you should know I will not hand over the money I collect from selling the tickets right away; You'll get it only after you perform the play...

Apparently, he was still afraid that we would take the money and run off. And we couldn't blame him, and we told him that we didn't think any other way, and that we indeed should receive the money only after we put on the performance.
