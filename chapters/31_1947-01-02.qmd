> With [Madame {{< var kalich >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/K/kalich-bertha.htm) in [{{< var z-libin >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/L/libin-z.htm)'s play. -- The end of the "Professor" who reigned for many years on the Yiddish stage.

The whole time I played in the Windsor Theater, I knew that every time we put on a new play by {{< var horowitz >}}, the last act would not be finished by the first performance. It became like a {{< var minhag >}}^["minhag," a Jewish ritual/custom] which you can't change. The "Professor" never seemed to be in a rush to write the last act, and usually he assumed that, when it came time to put on the show, we'd figure it out.

When we put on his historical operetta {{< var white-black >}}^[Also called, {{< var sons-israel >}}], which told the story of the lost ten tribes, he also hadn't finished the last act when it came time for the first performance. And as always, the "Professor" found a way to handle it; just as he did in {{< var yiziat >}}, at the end of {{< var white-black >}} he came up on stage and gave a long monologue with the words, "Jews, we are going to return to Eretz Yisroel." When he finished the monologue, the chorus sang some song which I no longer remember, and after the performance was over, he didn't remember at all what he said - not how he began the monologue, and not how he ended it.
