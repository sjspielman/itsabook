> An interesting story with {{< var shild-full >}} while performing Tolstoy's {{< var kreuzer >}}



::: {layout-ncol=2}

At that time, {{< var edelstein >}} had hired the famous German-Jewish actor {{< var shild-full >}} to play in People's Theater, and that in and of itself was quite a sensation because {{< var shild >}} had come to America with a German troupe. {{< var shild >}} had made a worldwide name for himself playing Shakespeare's Shylock as well as acting in other plays from the world repertoire. He spoke a rich, delicious Yiddish, and everyone wanted to snatch him up to play on the Yiddish stage. Everyone was anxious to see him perform.<br><br>
In People's Theater, {{< var shild-full >}} appeared in his repertoire; he played Shakespeare's Shylock and King Lear, and also {{< var asch-full >}}'s {{< var vengeance >}}. In that same season, he appeared in {{< var a-shomer >}}'s new play {{< var maziq >}}, and his acting made a big splash^[There are two interesting articles about this play. [First](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/dwt/1911/08/26/01/article/60) is a review of {{< var shild >}} in the play published in {{< var vahr >}}. [Second](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/tjm/1911/08/24/01/article/53) is an article from before the premiere when the theater opened the dress rehearsals for audiences to attend. According to the article, this was the first time a Yiddish theater had a public dress rehearsal.].

The Novelty Theater in Brooklyn, where I was hired to play in the troupe {{< var sara-adler >}} and {{< var shild-full >}} had put together, was just like the story about how they built a new {{< var shul >}} not because they needed one - but because the two {{< var gabbaim >}} couldn't share the limelight in the same {{< var shul >}} so they built a new one. For a change, {{< var sara-adler >}} was a little angry with her husband {{< var jacob-adler >}}. She wanted to show him that she could achieve great things on her own and that the audiences highly valued her talent, so she went off and rented the Novelty Theater in Brooklyn - or better said, in some far off corner of Williamsburg. To ensure her great success, she brought the famous {{< var shild-full >}} into her troupe. And you have to admit - you couldn't have imagined with a better combination, because both {{< var sara-adler >}} and {{< var shild-full >}} have graced the best stages in the world with their talent and they both performed well in the best pieces in the world. And the fact that the first piece they put on in the Novelty Theater was Tolstoy's {{< var kreuzer >}} alone showed just how talented they were.

We worked so hard in rehearsals that even in the Yiddish Art Theater no one has ever worked harder. You see, the lead role was played by {{< var shild-full >}} himself, and because it was clear from the plot that the lead role was semi-autobiographical, {{< var shild >}} played the part as though he weren't merely playing a great Russian prince, but Tolstoy himself. He immersed himself in the role so completely in a way that only such a God-blessed artist like {{< var shild >}} could do. No one else could create such a full character. 

Now, I'd like to say a few words about the difference between {{< var kessler >}} and {{< var shild >}}. Not about their different acting styles, but about the different characters. They both had their fair share of caprices, as great artists usually do. But while {{< var kessler >}} was never able to restrain himself and when he was in a rage there was simply no holding him back, {{< var shild >}} was a master at restraining his caprices. You could see this from how he acted during rehearsals and on the stage.

During rehearsals, he never got angry or insulted anyone. Even when he had to work with another actor or actress of lesser talent, he never lost his temper but showed them how to perform the scene, over and over again. He never got sick of working with someone on a scene. But when he happened across an actor who did have talent, he was very happy and would usually say that, rest assured, they would "do good."

He usually spoke in German when he directed us during rehearsals, so you might have thought that he doesn't know a word of Yiddish. But while performing, he spoke the best Yiddish, and he had such a mastery of the language that it really was something to admire. 

In general, he had a real knack for languages. He learned English in only a short time and played Shakespeare's Shylock on the English stage, and he interpreted the character in such a way to make the Shylock, the Jew, the most sympathetic character on stage. He also performed pieces in Hebrew. We all marveled at the authentic, folksy Yiddish he spoke on stage. We also marveled at how well he read [Peretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._L._Peretz) and what a master he was of all the Yiddish dialects.

But only on the stage - the second he came down from the stage, he went back to speaking German. 

Playing with {{< var shild >}} was not only an honor, but a pleasure. You could always learn something from him while playing with him.
