> When I played {{< var shabtai-golem >}} in {{< var laiteiner >}}'s {{< var lostsoul >}}. -- The two popular songs {{< var wiseson >}} and {{< var purim-nes >}}.


As in every city, in Pittsburgh we also had a group of very good Jews^[וואילע אידען] who were there for us and were ready to do anything for us, simply because they loved Yiddish theater and enjoyed that they could somehow be of help to the traveling Yiddish actors.

These good Jews, who in their simplicity had a lot of {{< var haimishkeit >}}, were then in all the cities and towns of America, and Abba Schehngold was able to find them everywhere he went. And he didn't only need them because they were well-connected and he could hitch his wagon to them to sell tickets for the show, but also because they could find some kind of home for his children and would take care of them while he was busy acting. 

At that time he became a, the actor {{< var abba-full >}}; His children were still small then; His son Joe, who years later became a well-known actor and married Adler's daughter Frances^[The daughter of {{< var jacob-adler >}} and {{< var sara-adler >}}], was a little boy then. And since {{< var abba-full >}} loved his children very much and he was extraordinarily loyal and devoted to them, he took them with him everywhere he traveled to play, and people knew that the first thing he did when he arrived somewhere in a city was find a home for his children in a respectable household where they would be well looked after. And he usually found such a home with the help of one of those good Jews who loved Yiddish theater and who were always ready to help out a wandering Yiddish actor.

In general, those good and happy Jews played an important role in the lives of the Yiddish actors, who for many years traveled the provinces playing Yiddish theater in all the cities and towns of America. If it weren't for them, the situation of the traveling Jewish of would have been much worse, not knowing who, in these cities far from home, was well-connected and how to earn a piece of bread from some performances.

This is indeed why I have to mention those good Jews. They earned it. And by the way, I want to say that there were also those among them, whose love for the Yiddish theater, little by little, drove them to become "stage managers" and this was a kind of side income for them. In many cities at that time, such stage managers could be found. And also in Pittsburgh we had someone like that, who was something of a stage manager. He took care of us and took on the work of  with us and took on the job of acquiring a theater and also providing the necessary wardrobe for the performances.

This was a side income for him and he already had a bit of experience in this.

In Pittsburgh, we played {{< var laiteiner-full >}}'s play {{< var lostsoul >}}, and {{< var schoen >}} gave me the role of {{< var shabtai-golem >}}, and I really enjoyed and felt elevated by this because, this role had good singing and speaking parts and you could stand out in front of the audience.


I was a really big hit with the song {{< var wiseson >}}. The audience simply did not want to let me off the stage, and I had to sing the couplets over and over again. And that was of course not just because I sang the song so well, but also because the song was very popular in those days; Everyone knew the song and it was sung everywhere.

As an experienced actor, I already knew that the more popular a song is, the more people want to hear it, and with the certainty that even before I start, I already have the audience with me, I immediately became lively and cheerful, and I went out on the stage with a bang: 

_Lyrics._^[Most of the lyrics of this song are too complex for me to reliably translate.]


And, while snapping my finger and winking my eye:

> The wise son!
>
> The wise son!
>
> The wise son - 
>
> from the four questions.
