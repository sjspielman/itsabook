> [{{< var simonoff >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/S/simonoff-moshe.htm)'s constant "no" in the Hebrew Actors' Union. - [{{< var ivan-abramsom >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/A/abramson-ivan.htm) and the comedian [{{< var berl-b >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/B/bernstein-berl.htm). - Why people called him _Berele Hope_^["Hope" as used here does not mean hope as in English; it means "hup/hop!" as in, "_hup_, let's go!"].


The strike that the Hebrew Actor's Union waged in New York's People's Theater led to a complete revolution in our little theater world The union won the strike, and from then on the actors stopped playing for "stamps" and started receiving weekly salaries.

When we heard in Chicago that the strikers at the People's Theater in New York had won, we were very happy about it. And after we finished the season in Chicago, I left for New York, and I was sure that I would certainly be accepted into the union there very soon, because they already knew how well I reacted when they offered me money to come and play at the People's Theater during the strike.

This alone - that I behaved like a good union man even before I was accepted into the union - was, in my opinion, enough for them to see as one of them, as someone who deserves to be a union member - not to mention the fact that I already had a name as a good comedian and people had already heard a lot about me in the Yiddish/Jewish circles in New York.

At that time, I wanted very much to be admitted to the union and to be able to settle in New York with my family, because I was tired, so very tired, of {{< var schlepping >}} around the cities and towns where you never knew what would happen to you or where you would end up next. I was sick of wandering around and I wanted to have a permanent home.

But they didn't want to admit me to the actors' union. They locked their doors to me, and I remember how at that time I heard that the actor {{< var simonoff >}} waged a campaign - for every candidate who came to try out for the Actor's Union, the vote should be - "No."

A lot of jokes were told in theater circles at the time about {{< var simonoff >}}'s constant "No" vote for new candidates of the Actor's Union. Jokes that really made you laiugh out loud. But I did not find it funny, and I left New York with a deep sorrow in my heart and settled again in Philadelphia, as I always used to do when I was eagerly on the lookout for my next steps and racking my brain about what will happen to me later.

From the experiences I had already had, I knew that I would not fail; I'd find something, somewhere to earn my piece of bread. And so it was.

Before the summer ended^[the summer of 1900], a Jew with a big name in the Yiddish theater world came to Philadelphia, and soon it became known that he was putting together a troupe, a Yiddish troupe, who would play the whole season in Columbia Theatre^[[Demolished in 2022](https://phillyyimby.com/2022/03/2709-15-cecil-b-moore-avenue.html), this historic theater was located at 2709 Cecil B. Moore Avenue - which used to be named Columbia Avenue until it was renamed for the civil rights leader in 1987].

That Jew was named Ivan Abramson. He was the husband of the Yiddish actress [Lisa Einhorn](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/E/einhorn-lisa.htm), who played the first {{< var shulamith-role >}} on the Yiddish stage in 1880. Ivan Abramson came from Russia, and it was said that he came to America when he was still a young man of 16 or 17 years old, and he was one of {{< var gordin >}}'s first followers. He loved Yiddish theater, and he had literary pretensions and had once published a humorous weekly in New York called {{< var pok >}}^[The was a satirical paper published in New York from 1894-1986.].

In general, Ivan was one of those people who threw money around. And every time, when he took on something new, he talked about it with enthusiasm that talked it up as something grand, very grand. When he began to assemble the troupe in Philadelphia, he also talked about it like this - that it could really mean that soon Philadelphia could surpass New York. When he engaged me to play with him at the Columbia Theater, I was very pleased and I did not complain about the wages; It turned out that my wife and I, together, would both receive twenty-five dollars a week.

The troupe consisted of actors who were already known. I remember that these actors played in the troupe: [Joe Kessler](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/K/kessler-joseph.htm), [Elias {{< var rothstein >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/R/rothstein-elias.htm), Samuel Shneyer, [Madame Rae Shneyer](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/S/shneyer-rae.htm) and many others. But the leading actor was Berl Bernstein, who was known as a very good comedian, and audiences loved him very much.
