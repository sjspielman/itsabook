In those days, a Yiddish troupe played in the Windsor Theater on the Bowery, where the Manhatten Bridge now stands, and the managers of the troupe were {{< var heine-full >}} and the "Professor" [{{< var m-horowitz >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/H/horowitz-halevy-moshe-ish.htm), the "king" of all sorts of historical and non-historical operettas on the Yiddish stage. <br><br>
Legends circulated all around New York about the "Professor" {{< var m-horowitz >}}, who loved to sign his name as {{< var halevy >}}, and there was nothing he could do about all these legends being written about him.
