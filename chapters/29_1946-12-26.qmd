> How the "Professor" {{< var m-horowitz >}} wrote a play. -- His operetta **{{< var yiziat >}}**^[יציאת מצרים]. --  An interesting story with a song about [{{< var moses >}}'s^[Moses] staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_of_Moses). 

The messenger who came to tell me that {{< var horowitz-full >}}, the "Professor" himself as he was called, wanted to see me was [{{< var shor >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/S/schorr-anshel.htm). And as usual, he behaved as though this whole matter was a secret that should be kept from the whole world.

He was still a {{< var griner >}}^[A greenhorn; naive new immigrant], {{< var shor-full >}}, very energetic and very skilled. But he quickly caught on and adapted to the American ways, so they called him "the yellow {{< var griner >}}." {{< var heine >}} gave him the name, and it stuck.

In the Windsor Theater, {{< var shor-full >}} was the "Professor"'s right hand man, and he attended to everything the "Professor" needed. When a song needed to be written, he wrote a song, and when a scene needed to be staged, he staged a scene. And on top of this, he understood the audience well and knew what they wanted.

In those days, a Yiddish troupe played in the Windsor Theater on the Bowery, where the Manhatten Bridge now stands, and the managers of the troupe were {{< var heine-full >}} and the "Professor" [{{< var m-horowitz >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/H/horowitz-halevy-moshe-ish.htm), the "king" of all sorts of historical and non-historical operettas on the Yiddish stage. <br><br>
Legends circulated all around New York about the "Professor" {{< var m-horowitz >}}, who loved to sign his name as {{< var halevy >}}, and there was nothing he could do about all these legends being written about him.
